## Overview


## Business Problem

To understand the sentiment towards brands, we need to break down Tweets and ____. Classifying Twitter post into different sentiments can help to find ways to improve brand images and products.

## Data

We utilized a dataset from CrowdFlower that has over 9,000 Tweets about Apple and Google products.

## Method

### Initial Data Setup

Drop ambiguous data and divide into each brand.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

In our notebook, we created wordclouds to show the top words in the Positive and Negative sentiment.

### Models

## Conclusions

## Further Research

For further development of our models, we can continue to branch out into other brands. It also looks like a majority of this data was from a particular event during SXSW, so taking Tweets from a larger span of time may help to improve our model accuracy.
